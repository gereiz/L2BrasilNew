<html><body>Lackey Freyja:<br>
Ice fairy Taif Freyja was a maid before Frey became a snow Queen. We don't know why, but it was turned into a huge block of ice. Freya has returned to her life, but could no longer serve the Fairy.<br>
Even though her anger and torment her, crushed Taif remained true to his mistress and thus came to stay in the garden of Freyja. We recently learned that the snow Queen also granted the power to pull strength from Sirre life of any creature within the garden. Thus, if you kill obitataelej first, then you will be easier to kill an ice Fairy.<br>
