We are fortunate that Frei is missing because we have never been able to threaten her privileged guards. We soblaznim them a silver Gemocitom, which you have given me.<br>
If you enter the grounds before closing the door, then I'll be able to help you. So please go there only as the gate closed. Until then, you can poždat′ here and make your preparation. Don't forget: your goal is to get rid of the ice fairy, pest, which unfairly approved by the Queen.<br>
