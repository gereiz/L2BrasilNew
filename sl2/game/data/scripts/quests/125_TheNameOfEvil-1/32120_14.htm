<body>Balu Kaimu:<br>
I connected with my brother Ulu Kaimu who was woken up by the word Schillen.
I shared with them information about you.
In fact the news flow of the story from the island to our current meeting is available to us.<br>
And only with the will of Schillen I talk with you now. So, čužezemez, tell me what kind of wisdom you want from Balu Kaimu?<br>
