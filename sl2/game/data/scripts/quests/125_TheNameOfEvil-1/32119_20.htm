<body>Ulu Kaimu:<br>
My brother Balu Kaimu stands under a tree near the road. You'll see it if you go to <font color="LEVEL">South</font>.
You can talk to him as well as me.<br>
Say the word <font color="LEVEL">toon</font>, who first uttered when Schillen gave him life. Then he will share their wisdom with you. </body></html>
