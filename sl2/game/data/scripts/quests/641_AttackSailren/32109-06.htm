I am avatar of Shilen.<br1>
Shilen ordered me to look after the island and protect it from the evil creatures.<br1>
Bear this responsibility becomes more and more difficult. But I went with prayers to the Shilen, and she decided that would send here a warrior who can fight the danger that threatens us all.<br1>
Are you sure the Warrior? No ... You are too weak to be a warrior, referred to by the mother of Shilen.<br>
