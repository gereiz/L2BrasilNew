<html><body>Darin:<br>
Do you know what is more frightening than a knight's sword or a magician's spell? It's love. Love comes unexpectedly, swallows up your soul, and never lets go. I am suffering, because of this "love" that the minstrels sing their silly ballads and  noble ladies gossip about. I have no desire or appetite... I hate myself for being this way.<br>
(Quest for characters level 2 or high.)
